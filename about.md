# ImGui Hook for Geode

Template to use for creating a ImGui menu in Geode. Write all ImGui code in ImGuiHook::DrawGUI.
Comes with support for keyboard and mouse input and comes fully ready to use.

This was done by stripping down mat's DevTools ImGui implementation down to just the necessities.
Special Thanks to Mat/matcool, HJFod, and the rest of the Geode Team.
